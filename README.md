# March Madness Bracket Generator

A bracket generator for those too lazy to make march madness brackets.

## Description

This project is a way for me to generate march madness brackets without having to actually put thought into them.  Every year I study which teams are hot, which teams are cold, and still end up with a terrible bracket.  So why spend all that time making a terrible bracket if a computer can make a slightly better bracket for you.
